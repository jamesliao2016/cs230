What is the impact of this headline that contributes to determine increase of the market? And given a collection of headlines when combined together determines to increase market?

sentence embedding -> knowledge of learned features (FNN/CNN/RNN?) -> tanh (impact) -> reduce sum -> sigmoid (market increase yes or no)


___

	d = day
	D = num days (d e D is batch size)
	S = num sentence per day  # plot bar distrib on each day
	k = words in each sentence
	W = N.N.k 
	X = flattened sentence embeddings
	Y = [0,1]  # softmax sentiment based on most influential sentence (by BOW) of day
